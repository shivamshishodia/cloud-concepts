## Basic YAML Configurations
- Each YAML has three parts: metadata, specification, and status.
- Labels are part of metadata and selectors are part of specification.
- Labels and selectors are used to setup communication.
- Status is auto generated and held by etcd inside master nodes.
- Specification have templates which have their own specifications (ex. of pods.).

## Applying YAMLs
- Apply deployment YAML `kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml`.
- Apply service YAML `kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml`.
- Get the pods (2 replicas) `kubectl get pods`.
- Get the services. It will listening on port 80 `kubectl get services`.
- Fetch the endpoints the service will divert traffic to using `kubectl describe service nginx-service`. The endpoints would be two 8080 ports (2 replicas of pod). 
- Cross check the IP and port displayed above using `kubectl get pods -o wide`. The two replica pods will have their IPs listed.
- Get the actual YAML generated by K8s `kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment -o yaml`.
- Delete deployment `kubectl delete -f nginx-deployment.yaml`.
- Delete service `kubectl delete -f nginx-service.yaml`.
